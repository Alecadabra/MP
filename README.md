# Machine Perception (Curtin University)

Part of my Computer Science degree at Curtin University.

Syllabus:

> This unit provides an introduction to the general machine perception problem. It covers image data capture and
processing (including data compression and biometrics) as well as video processing. Applications covered include
speech recognition, 3D object recognition and object tracking. Tools used in machine perceptions are also
addressed, including syntactic pattern recognition, string/graph matching, statistical pattern recognition, decision
trees (especially the C4.5 algorithm) and neural networks.

Weekly unasessed worksheet questions to demonstrate that week's course content. I don't provide the worksheets
that these are based on for copyright reasons so they don't make a lot of sense without context.
